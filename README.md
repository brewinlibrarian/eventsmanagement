# Approach
An Agile Scrum framework will be used to design and develop the product with DPL having primary Product Ownership responsibility. Product scoping will be accomplished in regular consultation with AHML prior to Sprint Planning meetings. AHML’s IT Manager will join DPL’s existing Scrum Team and will attend regular Sprint Planning and Review meetings, as well as Retrospectives. DPL will also provide one Drupal development consultant to the Scrum Team as resources allow.
